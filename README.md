# vector_fields

This is a [forked](https://github.com/tiagobilo/vector_fields) package for Python functions developed to deal with vectorial fields.
The streamfunction and velocity potential fields are calculated following [Li et al. (2006)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/MWR3249.1).

See the [Example](https://github.com/iuryt/vector_fields/blob/master/Example.ipynb) to understand the usage.
